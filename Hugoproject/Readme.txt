Hello,
This text document explains some functionalities and some important points of our project.

Concerning the DB and the data :
the files are located in the PHP folder.
There are :
- a sql script to create the tables
- a php script to recover the data formerly present in the json in order to insert them in the DB.

IMPORTANT: in order to execute the php script, we put in the navbar a tab named "data".
After having imported the sql file and having created the data base, it is necessary to click on this tab so that the importation is carried out.
It is important to note that this tab is only present for people who want to run our project.
This tab is in no way a feature present on the final version of the site.

Concerning the admin accounts, it is possible to connect as admin using the identifiers present in the json file identifier.json.
The admin account allows to display the stocks.
Otherwise it is possible to create an account, but a normal account does not have the same features as an admin account.
